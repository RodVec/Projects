# My Portfolio

A portfolio is a collection of representative work. My portfolio is a set of different projects that I have done in my academic time. 
Some of the programming that I have learned is: R notebooks (R markdown documents and the associated html document resulting from preview), Pyhon, and C++
Also, you can find other projects that I have complete, such as my Final Degree Project, the design of an industrial installation (mecanic and electric), the design of a industrial warehouse.

A notebook is a short analysis of a problem, illustrating a particular skill that I have learned. Below, I show the skills demonstrated in each programming language.

Some example skills that I have demonstrated in R:
- Visualizing data using ggplot2 (scatterplot, histogram, barchart, lineplot)
- Manipulate data (demonstrate dplyr verbs filter, summarise, join, select, rename, slice)
- Data loading and tidying and cleaning (to include pivot-wider and pivot-longer)
- Data science process (major steps).
