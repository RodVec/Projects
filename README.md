# My Portfolio

A portfolio is a collection of representative work. My portfolio is a set of different projects that I have done in my academic time. 
Some of the programming that I have learned is: R notebooks (R markdown documents and the associated html document resulting from preview), Pyhon, and C++
Also, you can find other projects that I have complete, such as my Final Degree Project (TFG), the design of an industrial installation (mecanic and electric) and the design of a industrial warehouse.

A notebook is a short analysis of a problem, illustrating a particular skill that I have learned. Below, I show the skills demonstrated in each programming language.

Some example skills that I have demonstrated in R:
- Visualizing data using ggplot2 (scatterplot, histogram, barchart, lineplot)
- Manipulate data (demonstrate dplyr verbs filter, summarise, join, select, rename, slice)
- Data loading and tidying and cleaning (to include pivot-wider and pivot-longer)
- Data science process (major steps).



Resume of my Final Degree Project (TFG):

Title - ADAPTACIÓN DE BUQUE A NUEVAS FUNCIONES

ABSTRACT

This project study if the FPSO Petrojarl Foinaven can be converted into a "shuttle tanker", a more conventional oil tanker that only transports crude oil from the point of extraction of crude oil in the ocean to the refinery, unloading it there. For this project, the system of pipes and pumps of the crude tanks has been studied to be able to unload the crude in less time than the minimum time established by the refineries.
Subsequently, since the crude oil cannot be pumped at temperatures below 40ºC, the heat transmission of the crude oil with its surroundings during the transfer from the extraction point where the FPSO is currently located, East of Scotland, to the refinery in Rotterdam.
Due to the complexity of the equations for calculating the crude oil temperature, an ANSYS program has been developed. Likewise, an economic exercise of the profitability of the project for the next 15 years has been carried out. Lastly, an environmental study of the ship has been carried out and occupational risk prevention has been documented.
After the completion of the project, it has been concluded that the FPSO vessel Pretojarl Foinaven can be converted to a shuttle tanker vessel. Since the crude does not reach 40ºC. In addition, in the financial year of the next 15 years of the conversion of the vessel, it has been determined that the conversion of the FPSO vessel to a shuttle tanker vessel supposes a higher Return on Income than the case of buying from a shuttle tanker vessel. See “Tabla 28”. 

Keywords: FPSO, shuttle tanker, heat transmission, crude oil, hydraulic pump, conversion, vessel.
